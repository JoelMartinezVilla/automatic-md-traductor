## Description:
Automatic translation of Markdown-formatted files into the language of your choice using the [chatgpt-md-translator](https://github.com/smikitky/chatgpt-md-translator?tab=readme-ov-file) repository. The code creates a folder structure by language and generates translated copies of your ".md" files.
This can be useful if you manage website content through these types of files.

## Usage Method:
You need to install the [chatgpt-md-translator](https://github.com/smikitky/chatgpt-md-translator?tab=readme-ov-file) repository by following the steps in the provided link.
Install Node.js by following the instructions in this link: [Node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).
In the "script.js" file, you can modify the values of the `languages` variable to translate your files into those languages.

Place your original files that you want to translate inside the "origin" directory.
Finally, open a console, navigate to the directory where you have the "script.js" file, and execute the command `node script.js`.
A directory named "target" will be created, containing all your translated files organized into different subdirectories based on their language.
